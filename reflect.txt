COURSE     : OOP 345 NFF
SUBMISSION : OOP 345 PROJECT (Reflect)

In this course, all the workshops helped me to not only understand the concepts, but also implementing them in the real examples. Moreover, due to workshop, I naturally remembered all the topics rather than memorizing them thoroughly. Additionally, I learn the debugging and made it more stronger. Apart from workshops, the quizes motivated me to read the concepts weekly.
